# Alamokemon
Intentionally simple app to demonstrate API wizardry via Alamofire and CocoaPods integration.  This app is a demonstration of concept
and thus not intended to be perceived as a completed project.

Alamokemon does only two things:
1) Fetch a list of the first X number of pokemon
2) Display color-coded page of information and associated sprites for selected pokemon

This app uses Alamofire to interact with the pokeapi.co API, as well as several dependencies via CocoaPods and a few self-made libraries.


In the future Alamokemon might do these things:
1) Allow wider (or circuituous) range pokemon on main view
2) Feature information for items, abilities, etc
